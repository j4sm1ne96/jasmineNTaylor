Context:

I started this personal website as part of my coding traineeship with IT CareerSwitch, but it also showcases other projects that I have been working on in my freetime. In particular I have enjoyed the vanilla javascript projects, which I learned how to do through YouTube tutorials. 
One of the projects (gazetteer - an interactive map) is still a work in progress, but I aim for it to be able to eventually move to any country that I select via the drop-down menu and for the modals to provide information about each selected country.

The whole website has been designed and then coded by myself, with inspiration taken from other people's personal websites.
